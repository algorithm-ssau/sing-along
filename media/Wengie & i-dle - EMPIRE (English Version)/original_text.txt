One day they will build empires for me
From the dirt to the sky for the world to see
Bow down as they build empires for me
One day they will build empires for me
See the crown, see the crown, her majesty
Bow down as they build empires for me
Never die, live fast, it's my empire
Put my face on the cash, it's my empire
Put the bricks to the bricks, watch 'em get higher
Lay back, let 'em, let 'em build my empire
(Minnie)
Empire, represent it
So much money, I could never spend it
Make it hail on 'em, blizzards
And for the rest of my haters, kiss, kiss
Bang bang, two bags
My cash, my bad
And when they shoutin' my name
Best believe what they say
'Cause one day
One day they will build empires for me
From the dirt to the sky for the world to see
Bow down as they build empires for me
One day they will build empires for me
See the crown, see the crown, her majesty
Bow down as they build empires for me
Never die, live fast, it's my empire
Put my face on the cash, it's my empire
Put the bricks to the bricks, watch 'em get higher
Lay back, let 'em, let 'em build my empire
Rollin' in the streets with the top off
The sun shines brighter with the top off
I think this drink needs a top off
Yeah, so I can take my... (Oh my God)
'Cause that's what you want
That's what you like
Put you on ice like the others
Down on your knees, bow to the queen
'Cause one day
One day they will build empires for me
From the dirt to the sky for the world to see
Bow down as they build empires for me
One day they will build empires for me
See the crown, see the crown, her majesty
Bow down as they build empires for me
Never die, live fast, it's my empire
Put my face on the cash, it's my empire
Put the bricks to the bricks, watch 'em get higher
Lay back, let 'em, let 'em build my empire
(Wengie)
(Minnie)
Lay back, let 'em, let 'em build my empire
